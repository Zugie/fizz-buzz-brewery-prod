This is the current production build for the Vue app portion of our project website. Updating this build triggers an automatic rebuild of the front end of the site by the Google App Engine. The full code can be found at: https://github.com/adeckert1010/BreweryFinder

This website was built as the Capstone Project for Tech Elevator. The website can be found at fizzbuzzbrewery.com. 

The front end of the site is built with Vue.js and runs on the Google App Engine. The API was built with ASP.NET, and it runs in the Microsoft Azure cloud with a SQL Server database.
